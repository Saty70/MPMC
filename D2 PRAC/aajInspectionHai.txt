1) write a program that finds the number of 1s in a byte
2) write a program that finds the number of 1s in a word provided tha word is in BCD 1 word =16 bit
3) decide parity is even or odd if p is even set DL 0 else DL 1 given number maybe a multi byte number take 4 bytes
4) write a program to add two multi byte numbers and store the result as a third number the numbers are stored in the form of bute list stored with the lowest byte first
5)
